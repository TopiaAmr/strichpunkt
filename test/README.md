# Running Tests for User Profiles

This directory contains tests for the User Profiles feature of the Strichpunkt application. The tests are organized according to the Clean Architecture pattern, mirroring the structure of the main application code.

## Test Structure

``` dart
test/
└── features/
    └── user_profiles/
        ├── data/
        │   ├── datasources/
        │   │   ├── user_profile_local_data_source_test.dart
        │   │   └── user_profile_remote_data_source_test.dart
        │   ├── models/
        │   │   └── user_profile_model_test.dart
        │   └── repositories/
        │       └── user_profile_repository_impl_test.dart
        ├── domain/
        │   └── usecases/
        │       └── get_user_profile_test.dart
        └── presentation/
            └── cubits/
                └── get_user_profiles_cubit_test.dart
```

## Documentation

All test files include dartdoc comments that explain:

- The purpose of each test file
- What functionality is being tested
- The expected behavior for each test case

This documentation helps developers understand the tests and makes it easier to maintain them over time.

## Running Tests

To run all the tests for the user profiles feature, use the following command:

```bash
flutter test test/features/user_profiles/
```

To run specific test files, specify the path to the test file:

```bash
flutter test test/features/user_profiles/data/models/user_profile_model_test.dart
```

## Dependencies

The tests require the following packages which are already defined in the pubspec.yaml:

- `flutter_test`: Flutter's testing library
- `mockito`: For mocking dependencies
- `bloc_test`: For testing BLoC/Cubit components

## Generating Mock Classes

Some tests use mock classes generated by the mockito package. Before running these tests, make sure to generate the mock classes by running:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This will generate the necessary mock files for the tests.
